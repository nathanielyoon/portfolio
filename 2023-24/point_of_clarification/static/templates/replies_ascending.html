Two reasons
First is for APDA, I often heard that the best PMRs would do warrant level weighing instead of just impact calculus, and this is something I want to personally learn to do and emulate.
The second is I hope to use this in BP to be able to weigh closing half contributions over opening half.
The thing I struggle with particularly is in BP, I often find myself link weighing at closing by pointing out the opposite sides responses, conceding it and then saying our argument doesn't fall prey to that. This isn't weighing as much as it is meta debating and I dislike that.
The thing I struggle with specifically in APDA is using link weighing to resolve gov vs opp clashes, rather than just different contributions on the same side of the debate.

What are ways to improve performative skills? I feel like my lack of performative strengths (like a commanding voice, hand gestures, etc.) is really hindering my debate success, but I don't know how to overcome all of that.

I try to read a lot about race, because I started off knowing woefully little about those who aren't like me. I know that reading will never be a 100% accurate substitute for the real life experience of individuals, but I am genuinely curious as to how social dynamics (especially regarding race) have evolved over time, and am always eager to engage in discussions with people about these things. However, when I'm in a round against a debater/debaters of color in a round about race, I've repeatedly been called out for being "racist" or "presumptive" in my argumentation in the round. After the first few times it happened, I asked my partner afterwards to help me understand what I should be saying differently, but he too was at a loss.
My question is this: In rounds about contentious and personal issues like race, where one or more parties in the room may have been affected by the issue being discussed, what recommendations do you guys have about feeling comfortable engaging with your opponent's argumentation as deeply as possible while not offending individuals or making them feel uncomfortable?</td>

        <td>One skill area which a lot of people struggle with and which is one of the most difficult to explicitly learn is how to use language well. People often talk about content and rhetoric as if they’re two separate things – logical truths and tricky sophistry which can each exist without the other. This is untrue and counterproductive in learning to convey meaning well. All argumentative content is conveyed through rhetoric and what makes rhetoric good is its ability to convey more or deeper meaning. Sentences and arguments aren’t discrete lines of computer code that a listener\judge can unambiguously execute because all communication is interpretive and contexts and framing can dramatically shift levels of meaning attributed to a particular phrase or series of statements. This is particularly true since time constraints usually mean that the models of the world each team is building can’t be complete. Debate naturally emphasizes the more surface\explicitly layer of meaning, but the “soft” layers of meaning within language are still useful and dramatically underutilized in rounds, especially since they don’t trade off with the surface\explicit layer when done well. The thing that was most useful for me and some friends in learning to improve on use of language in rounds was increased exposure to alternate forms of public communication that put greater emphasis on the “soft” layer, particularly plays and poetry. Since April is national poetry month I thought this would be a good opportunity to start an open thread for poems that are helpful in expanding one’s use and control of language
To start, The Vinegar Club by Andrea Gibson was incredibly useful to me in learning to deliver content very intentionally and set a tone without an explicit two minute overview</td>

Did the rule change, or is the guideline saying that 3rd and 4th place teams can get 2 for place plus 7 for size?

        <td>As a (non-panelled) judge, I typically prefer to rule on points of order after hearing them. If I can rule outright, I do so. If I'm not able to rule after listening to both sides, I take it under consideration. And if I'm not entirely sure but immediately leaning one way or the other, I say so.
I prefer this because it seems that my response to the point is useful information for the debaters that will inform adjustments they might make in the rest of their rebuttal. It's also the most direct feedback on the point they'll get, and may forestall unnecessary future points of order of the sort that often disrupt rebuttals.
However, I notice that many judges seem to take most points under consideration and not rule on them until the RFD. This approach has the merits of being less disruptive or demoralizing to the speakers, and possibly also of allowing greater dilligence in ruling (although given the time constraints upon producing RFDs, I'm skeptical most points in either system will receive in-depth consideration unless they wind up being crucial for the RFD).
Is there a general consensus on which approach is better? Am I out of line with debaters' preferences? Should I simply ask debaters their preference on this before rebuttals start? Am curious to hear thoughts.</td>

-MO begins speech
-Gov rises for POI
-MO takes POI
-Question is asked
-MO responds to question by flagging a relevant argument from LOC
But then, the PMR says something like "This is why the POI during MO was so important" and advances a line of argumentation that adds several warrants to the underlying claim of the POI, even if MO did not make any new warrants specifically in response to that claim. This is sometimes regarded as new by judges and sometimes treated as not new since it was 'new' in MO.

Drawing the Global Color Line: White Men's Countries and the International Challenge of Racial Equality by Marilyn Lake and Henry Reynolds
The Global Cold War by Odd Arne Westad
Gordian Knot: Appartheid and the Unmaking of the Liberal World Order by Ryan Irwin (this one's actually the most accessible but the other two are way more useful)
Models (Debate is a competition of creating and describing incomplete models of how the world works under strict time constraints. Improving your understanding of the real world will increase how much you can draw on for those models, but it's also important to get better at translating real complexities into easily understandable and robust models. A lot of times when rounds get messy it's because debaters are confusing the real world for their or their opponents' model of the world - improving your mental toolbox of ways to discuss those models and do so precisely will make you much better at debating regardless of the topic):

        <td>Anonymous question #709:
I am beginning to think about novice recruitment for the 2021-2022 school year, and am wondering how to best go about recruiting and reaching out to novices from underrepresented backgrounds. Currently our team is extremely not-diverse. This is something that needs to change.
In previous years, the way we would go about recruitment is advertising info sessions, demo debates, making a mailing list, posting on social media, etc. However, we have noticed that initial interest in these introductory events has always been extremely white and cis (which makes sense, given how white and cis high school debate is, and how generally elitist the activity is perceived to be). Therefore, to get a more diverse class, we think it might be necessary to do something more than we are already doing.
This is where we find ourselves in a pickle. We thought about doing specific outreach to different affinity groups on campus, but we really really don't want to make anyone feel uncomfortable or like we only want them for their identity or anything. I'm a part of several underrepresented groups and I have always felt weird when clubs have reached out specifically to me in the past; regardless of what their true intentions were, i sometimes couldn't help but feel tokenized.
We also just don't want to put pressure on people to do an activity that they don't want to do. But, at the same time, we really want to make sure we are doing everything in our power to get a more diverse team and not get complacent.
So, for the teams that have successfully recruited and retained novices from underrepresented groups, what did you do that worked?
For those who tried something and failed, what did you try and what did you learn from the experience?
Also, if I am approaching this issue with the wrong mindset, please let me know. I hope that this thread can be one of support and learning across different clubs and perspectives.</td>

        <td>*MOD NOTE* The core of the following question is how to balance being an inclusive debate team versus being a competitive one when the two are at odds. I only include this note because I worry people will ignore the question due to its length and I think it's an important topic. Please read the whole question before commenting.
Anonymous question #320: Hi APDA! I have a question about team building that’s been frustrating me for a while. It’s a little rambly but please bear with me.
I’m on the e-board of a not-super-successful team (read: never broke 13th COTY). I’m also from a team that is predominantly white and male and has historically had a problem with retaining people of color, international students, and a host of identities that don’t fit the APDA mold. I have people yelling in one ear that our sole goal is to climb COTY and I have other people who are telling me that the team just isn’t inclusive enough.
It seems to me that, in the current state of APDA, these two goals are not only at odds with each other but run directly against one another, especially for a team that is resource-scarce to the point where this tradeoff has actual consequences. For example, since we only have a handful of varsities, a fraction of whom are active, we can only hand out so many pro-ams. So who do they go to, a student who, because of her EFL status and lack of high school experience will likely not break top 30 NOTY no matter how hard she tries, or to the ex-LD champ?
Definitionally, a “meritocracy” doesn’t allow for inclusivity at the point where privileged ex-high school debaters will be more willing to do practice rounds, more likely to not quit, and just generally more capable of standing out on all the other metrics that we use to approximate merit. This then excludes people who feel uncomfortable in an unfamiliar, often hostile, space or are apprehensive about trying a new activity and might need more attention and resources directed towards them so that they are even able to determine if this is an activity that they want to put time into. APDA, if this activity is as valuable as we think it is, then shouldn’t we do our best to help people overcome it’s many barriers to entry and to actively recruit underrepresented students regardless of whether they do end up sticking around for the long haul?
Of course, if you allocate resources this way, people who are used to a meritocratic debate team (read: ex high school debaters) will scream bloody murder. Honestly, maybe they’re right in being mad. After all, if debate is supposed to be a “serious sport”, no other sports team cares about giving everyone a shot to be quarterback…they just draft the best of the best. It’s especially easy to sympathize with ex-LD kid when they feel those resources are wasted because the people those resources were used on ended up not taking debate very seriously, and ex-LD kid is still here, wondering “wtf is going on. I go to every tournament every weekend.” To be clear, I really do want to see my team do well. I want people to stop laughing when they hear that they’re hitting my novices because nothing breaks my heart faster. Maybe climbing COTY will help with that?
Anyway, APDA hivemind, I just wanted to ask if a tradeoff exists, and if so, which way should I lean? Is there an “answer C” that I’m not seeing here?
If you actually read this far, I love you and thanks so much!</td>

I just think they all have a biased view of debate, in particular questions (ie questions about bad judges, or how to deal with partner dynamics) I just think if you're seeded/once you're in like the 2-1, 3-0, reppy debaters opinions can't help debaters typically in rounds in the 1-2 or 0-3. And in other cases, like how do I get better at xyz, their answers can often make debaters asking POCs feel bad since they can't just practice harder, or get good.
Note: This does not reflect the views of the POC page staff/NM Committee. This was a edgecase question and is only getting through since it seems to bring up a point worth discussing. Getting questions is kind of hard, and sometimes we get questions like these that are very border line for one reason or another. In this case we have to balance concern for APDA members and censorship. If you guys have feedback on these grounds, let me know</td>

This includes two really great resources: Matthew Rohn 's 59 Snazzy Rounds to learn debate document, and the Gender and Sexuality Empowerment Initiative's document of high-quality gender balanced rounds. Last year, I unbroke the links of the document, adding the GSEI's rounds as well (that weren't broken), and I think it's probably best to share this to the league. A couple of important notes about the document: There are no recent rounds; I think the most recent round is Nats Finals 2017. I'm going to echo Matt's earlier sentiment that more recent rounds are probably good for a wide variety of reasons -- if you have any suggestions for a good round, feel free to link it below and I'll probably add it. Due to opt outs, not every single video is still available. This is especially true for the gender balanced rounds; I think over half of the list wasn't available when I was going through it. If the video has a password and it is on APDA's website, it'll say "Password online." If I can't find the password, it'll say "password needed" or something like that. You can also probably DM me for passwords and I'll give them to you. There are now content warnings, but they are incomplete (I haven't watched every video, and I may not have content warned everything that should have been content warned). If there is something that should be content warned, let me know and I can add it to the document. Happy watching! https://docs.google.com/.../1BJf7awI.../edit...</td>

That’s pretty intimidating to do without much support from my team, and I’ve had a couple of really uncomfortable cliquey experiences while at tournaments.

Anonymous Question #660: hi! I have sadly had some bad experiences with triggering rounds at tournaments. one thing that has happened to me is that a round isn’t trigger/content warned or is poorly warned, and I end up realizing during POCs that this round isn’t something I can safely take part in. at that point, is it best to try to stop the round (telling the other team and the judge this round is uncomfortable for me and asking if they could change the case), to make my partner Ironman, or to just go along with the round and trigger call it? I don’t necessarily want to out myself for my trigger and have to stop or leave the round, but at the same time it feels difficult to have to interact with arguments and give a speech for a round that is triggering for me. I know there’s no simple or one-size-fits-all solution but I was just wondering if anyone had advice on this! thanks!!</td>

Usually when I walk into GA at a tournament, everyone is very laid back and just talks to all their friends and stays in certain cliques. I don't really have that kind of an opportunity and am pretty anxious and try to leave GA frequently to calm myself down. I am also easily deterred by cliques. The social aspect of GA just reminds me that I am very awkward and do not make friends very easily. Is there any way I can make more friends?</td>

        <td>This is a google doc of 59 rounds online that I thought were useful for learning debate, sorted by topic area. I formalized the list and made it public around when I graduated because I don't think that institutionally dominant schools like F&amp;M should horde novice training materials, and because besides advice from Emily, watching rounds online was basically the singular way I learned to debate well, and I know this has been true of a lot of people over the years, particularly from schools that didn't have established teams at the time. However, the list hasn't been substantively updated in about two years because I don't have the time or interest to trawl through all the videos, so I'm looking to hand this off to someone currently active on the league to update as new videos are posted and as things are transferred to the shiny new website. If you're interested, and have done a bunch of debate learning by watching rounds online, please message me
Also, this is a general appeal to current debaters to let your rounds go online. I know that the website transition has probably caused a lot of backlog, but from everything I've heard it seems there's been a pretty substantial decline in people consenting to their rounds going up over the last few years. If you're worried about burning your cases, just escrow the video until the end of the year. If you're worried about what future employers will think (1) you can password protect it through the forum, (2) the vast majority of your cases aren't something any employer would care about your views on, and (3) you can take them down at any point in the future if you're entering a field where anything might be an issue - Reid Bagwell did this with all of rounds he had online when he became a lawyer. There are three reasons it's important to have a good flow of contemporary videos:
1 - Styles of debate change and innovate over time
2 - While there are tons of rounds online, there are a relatively small number of good rounds on any given topic, meaning that people working to improve on something specific can always use more rounds in that area
3 - As the league becomes more diverse in terms of gender and race, the set of past videos becomes increasingly less representative of the current people on the league, and being able to see people like you as an example matters for inclusion and retention</td>

In my experience, if I write a case about racial groups or women or non-binary people, I am almost always told to CW/TW. I understand the importance of not forcing people of color to debate content about brutality (violent or graphic content in general), but I feel like the standard for diverse cases to CW is much lower. I don't think that these cases have any triggering content, and I feel like based on my identity that I am a relatively good judge of that. Many white people on my team have told me that I have an obligation to CW many of these cases, and I understand their perspective. I do think it is better to be safe than sorry, and I would never want to put another debater in an uncomfortable position. When I CW these cases, for pertaining to oppressed groups, I have encountered cis white opp teams and judges that always elect to not debate the case. I understand that this post is speculation, and these debaters could be triggered by discussing these groups. More often though it feels like CW cases that aren't triggering has resulted in me not being able to discuss (not graphic) diverse topics at all. I understand this is on a case by case basis, but I was curious to see if anyone had advice or similar experiences.</td>

I regularly read the news, but I still felt like I really didn't get what was going on in a lot of my foreign policy rounds at Swarthmore Novice last weekend. While I have a cursory understanding of what's going on in the world, there's just a lot I really don't know and it seems like a lot of information to digest. Frequently I'll click on NY Times articles on foreign affairs but will find that the info really only gives me a tiny tiny snapshot of what's going on without giving me the whole context/history of the situation, so it's just confusing. Also the info isn't packaged well for debate - for example an article about a war might say what the U.S. military strategy is but won't go into alternatives or flesh out how those relate to IR Theories. So I guess what I'm wondering is what is a good and efficient way to learn more about foreign affairs for debate? Are there things I can read that have quick summaries of what is going on and also put them in the context of history and different theories of international relations?</td>

As someone from a mid-sized APDA school, increases in the TOTY points qualification bar and free seed reform severely hurt my program. While everyone seems to care a lot about new expansion schools (which we should), I feel as if the mid-tiered schools are being ignored. A lot of the proposals try to cut slots for non-expansion schools, but I think it's important to recognize the proportionality of these cuts. Top schools like Yale or Brown can afford to lose one of the 8 spots they get to nationals with relatively little consequence, but for most mid-tier schools, losing 1 slot out of 2 to 3 is a much bigger deal. I don't want to post this publicly, since I'm scared that reppy judges from big schools will be even more biased against me, but I feel like it's an important discussion to be had for the members of marginalized schools who feel as if they can't speak up. Does anyone know of any methods to alleviate the hits on mid-tiered schools for Nationals? If so, please describe them and how they can be implemented."</td>
