# Portfolio

Hello! If you're here from my resume, you're probably wondering why there's
basically nothing related to CS (or STEM in general). I do all my programming
for fun, or for personal projects, so I didn't list it next to the more
"official" stuff.

Since taking AP Computer Science seven(!) years ago, I've had no training or
formal education,[^1] and haven't taken any online courses or programs. I had a
year off from school and during all but a few weeks here and there, I was coding
8-12 hours a day and reading/watching CS content in most of the remaining time.
Much of this was motivated by a long-running passion project which has gone
through hundreds of iterations, where after finishing a working prototype (or
most times, before) I'd tear the whole thing down and start again. About midway
through, I decided to forgo dependencies, so I've implemented a wide range of
library functionalities (especially in cryptography and data validation).

You can find the current version in the `current` directory, though it only has
some of the library functions. (It replaces `previous`, which didn't get much
further than the cryptography library.) The remaining two folders are mostly
side projects and me messing around. `2023-24` has code from my last semester
before the medical leave and during it, while `2024-25` is from this past summer
onward. In most cases, I copied the files without their neighboring
dependencies, but the code there should be enough to get the gist.

Everything in this repository was self-taught from the ground up. Additionally,
it has not been curated or prepared for public eyes. That is to say: excuse the
lack of clarity and documentation - when writing most of this stuff, I thought I
was the only one who'd have to suffer through future review.

Brief, non-exhaustive list of proficiencies:

- Cloudflare ecosystem (especially Pages, Workers, and R2/D1/KV, also DNS and
  rules)
- Typescript tools (Deno, Vite, Vitest, esbuild, pnpm, Tailwind, Web Components)
- Web APIs/DOM, as well as some Javascript web frameworks (Solid/SolidStart,
  Svelte/SvelteKit)
- Python web libraries (FastAPI, Starlette, Jinja, some Flask)
- Scripting in BASH, Typescript, and Python (descending order of comfortability)
- Hosting (Cloudflare, Deno Deploy, Fly.io, Vercel, Cloud Run, Firebase)
- Schema definitions (JSON Schema, Pydantic, msgspec, msgpack, JSON Type
  Definition, regular expressions if you count those)
- Serverless database hosts (Turso, Xata, Planetscale, Tembo, Cloudflare D1)

I haven't worked with some of that for a while, but I generally remember enough
to pick up again quickly. Right now, I'm most comfortable with Typescript/Deno,
Cloudflare, and BASH. But I'd love to talk about any of these topics, or any of
the code samples you find interesting. I really enjoy the experience of CS, and
would love to apply my love for the subject to whatever you might need me for.

[^1]: I'm currently taking Intermediate Programming (EN.601.220), which covers C
    and C++.
